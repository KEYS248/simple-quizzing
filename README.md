Simple quizzing programs for helping you study

Here are a couple programs that take in a CSV with the term in the first column and the definition in the second column. The programs can then continuously test you on the terms and defintions with multiple choice quizzes. 

**guess_term_mc.py** is the most refined and allows you to ask for hints. Hints are simply parts of the definition split up by commas. For best results, only use commas in the definition for hints you want to receive in the quizzing programs.

You can take your term and definition notes through Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or other programs and simply export them as a CSV for using these quizzing programs. Then change the first variable in the programs to the file name of your CSV.
